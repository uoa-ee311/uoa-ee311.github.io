# I/O Events

- I/O peripherals enable the microprocessor in an MCU to interface with external electrical signals
 - In our project we use GPIO, UART, ADC and Timer peripherals
- The peripherals often take considerable amount of time to complete a given task 
 - The time taken can be many system clock cycles and during this time the microprocessor can be executing code
 - For example, a UART transmitting at a low baud rate takes a considerable amount of time to send a byte of data
- The peripherals also have to respond to external signals which are non-deterministic (i.e. we don’t know when they will occur)
 - When we are trying to detect such signals, the microprocessor have to communicate regularly with the peripherals checking to see if they have occurred
 - For example, when checking for a push-button press, we have to regularly scan the GPIO pin it is connected at

---
name: S3

# Responding to I/O Events

- So far we used the polling method to respond to events (e.g. a peripheral completing a task or responding to an external signal)
 - When polling, which is also called “blocking” or “busy waiting”, the microprocessor waits to respond to the event
- Waiting for peripherals to complete tasks and responding to non-deterministic external signals keep the microprocessor unnecessarily busy
- To be efficient, the microprocessor needs to execute code in response to these events at the correct time rather than waiting for them to occur
 - For example, write a byte of data to UART transmit buffer (UDR0) when it is just emptied rather than waiting it to be empty
- The second method to respond to these events, is to use interrupts
 - Interrupts enable the microprocessor to respond to events at the correct time rather than waiting for them to occur

# Polling 

.center[<img src="img/Polling.png" height="160"> <img src="img/PollingCode.png" height="160">]

- So far we used polling when we interacted with the ADC  
- We executed code continuously in the form of a loop to check the state of a given register bit
 - For example, with ADC we checked if ADIF is set
- The register bit was checked as part of the normal program execution while halting the execution of the rest of the program
 - Once the appropriate state was detected, the action was taken and continued with the rest of the program

---
name: S5

# Benefits & Drawbacks of Polling

- Benefits of polling include
 - Simple to implement, and does not require any hardware
 - The processor is always in a known state when executing code, so race conditions and variable states do not have to be managed
- Drawbacks of polling include
 - If multiple peripherals require checking, it must do them in a round-robin fashion adding a delay between each check of a given peripheral
 - If two peripherals require servicing, they will be done in the order they are checked, which may not be the order of priority
 - Most of the time, the checking does not result in any work being done, so this processor time has been wasted
 - It can be very difficult to get the processor to run other code in between polling all of its peripherals


---
name: S6

# Interrupts

.center[<img src="img/Interrupt.png" height="220">]

- Interrupts were introduced explicitly to handle events
- When an event triggers an interrupt, the normal program execution is halted, and a special function is executed
 - This special function is called the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)
- Once the ISR has completed, the processor returns to the code it was executing before the interrupt occurred

---
name: S7

# Benefits & Drawbacks of Interrupts

- Benefits of interrupts include
 - Interrupts can respond to an event almost immediately
 - The interrupts can be given priorities to make sure the most important events are always responded to quickly 
 - The processor can be performing useful work while waiting for an interrupt to occur
- Drawbacks of interrupts include
 - Extra hardware is required to implement interrupts 
 - The state of the processor is not known when an interrupt occurs
 - Developing the code is more difficult, as the program must understand and handle any state which can be modified by an interrupt
 - Memory management becomes more complex

---
name: S8

# When to Use Interrupts

- Not every event is best handled by an interrupt
 - Sometimes it is easier to use polling
 - Sometimes you have sufficient processing resources that the penalty for polling is insignificant
- Interrupts should be used when an event has 3 main characteristics
 - Asynchronous: The event can occur at any time, and there is no way to predict when this will be
 - Urgent: The event needs to responded to immediately
 - Infrequent: The event is not occurring continuously
- An emergency shutdown event (such as over current) is an example of an event which is a good candidate for using an interrupt
- In contrast, if transmitting a few bytes of data over UART after processing some data, then in this example polling may be used

# Interrupts in Your Project

.center[<img src="img/PIControlConcept.png" height="160">]

- We need to measure output voltage, compare with a reference and pass through a digital PI controller 
 - The output of the PI controller is the **Compare Match** value loaded to generate the PWM output
- While doing the above, we also want to listen to user input requesting to change the output voltage 
 - It will be challenging to do both these tasks if we poll the ADC measurements
- We can setup the ADC to auto-trigger on a timer and use ADC **Conversion Complete Interrupt**
 - At the end of each ADC conversion, we need to process the measurement using the PI controller and update the **Compare Match** value
- In parallel, using ADC **Transmit Complete Interrupt** we should send measured voltage via UART

# What is an ISR?

- An MCU executes a normal program in and orderly sequence determined by the user
- When an interrupt occurs, the normal program execution is halted, and a special function is executed
 - This function is called the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)
- An ISR can be thought of as a function with no return value, and no input arguments
 - As always, there are exceptions, but in general this is the case
- The only way for an ISR to communicate with the rest of the program is through variables with shared scope
 - These are global variables with file level or unlimited scope (i.e. static or extern global variables)
- Once the ISR has completed, the processor returns to the code it was executing before the interrupt occurred
- Each interrupt normally has its own ISR
 - These ISRs will be executed in the order of their interrupt priority 
- ISRs are not called as part of the normal program execution

---
name: S11

# How to Use an ISR

.codes[
```c
//An ISR does not take any arguments, and does not return a result
ISR(NAME_vect){
  //Do something 	
}

void function_1(void){
  //Do something 	
}

void function_2(void){
  //Do something 	
}

int main(void){
	
	while (1){
    //We can call our functions, but NOT an ISR
		function_1();
		function_2();
	}	
}
```
]

name: S12

# ISR Communication

- As the ISR cannot be passed arguments or return a result, it can only communicate with the rest of the program by using global variables with file or unlimited scope
- As the interrupt can occur at any time, any variables written by the ISR can be modified at any point during regular execution
 - Normally the compiler does not expect this, so we must use the *volatile* keyword to alert it
- The *volatile* keyword prevents the compiler from optimizing the code under the assumption the variable will never change
- Failure to use the *volatile* keyword can result in code that crashes or doesn’t work

.codes[
```c
volatile uint8_t my_volatile_variable_1;          //Global variable with unlimited scope
extern volatile uint8_t my_volatile_variable_2;   //Global variable with unlimited scope
static volatile uint8_t my_volatile_variable_3;   //Global variable with file scope

int main(void){
 //Do something
}
```
]

---
name: S13

# ISR Communication Example

.codes[
```c
//millisecond_counter is not changed by the main function. Therefore, the compiler might infer that the 
//millisecond_counter is never updated. In this case, millisecond_counter can never be greater than 1000. 
//So the code can be removed (optimized out). The volatile keyword tells the compiler that the variable 
//is updated outside the normal program execution, and prevents the code from being removed.
volatile uint16_t millisecond_counter = 0;

//This ISR is called by a timer every millisecond
ISR(NAME_vect){
  millisecond_counter++;	
}

//This program toggles an LED every second
int main(void){
  TIMER_initialise_for_millisecond_interrupt();
  LED_initialise();
  while(1){		
    if (millisecond_counter > 1000) {   //Check if 1 second has passed
      LED_toggle();                     //Toggle the LED
      millisecond_counter = 0;          //Reset the counter
    }		
  }	
}
```

# ISR Execution (PI)

- The microcontroller has special hardware lines which can be set to signal an interrupt has occurred
- The address of each ISR is stored at a dedicated location in the program memory (usually it is the first thing) in the form of a table 
 - This table is called the “Interrupt Vector Table”
 - The position of the interrupt in this table also determines its priority 
- When an interrupt occurs, the microprocessor completes the current instruction, and stores the address of the next instruction (i.e. the program counter) on the stack
- Then the address for the ISR of the interrupt that occurred is loaded by the processor to the program counter, and execution of ISR continues from that point
 - In ATmega328P global interrupts are disabled to avoid nested interrupts
- Upon completing the ISR, the address stored on the stack is loaded back into the program counter, and execution resumes from that address
- If other interrupts occurred while executing an ISR, they will be processed in the order of priority after completing the first one

# ATmega328P Interrupts

- The ATmega328P supports multiple interrupt sources and these include
 - GPIO level changes
 - UART receive complete, transmit buffer empty
 - ADC conversion completion
 - Timer compare match, overflow
- The interrupt priority is fixed where lower addresses in interrupt vector table have a higher priority
- All interrupt sources have their own interrupt enable bit that needs to be set
 - The global interrupt enable bit needs to be also set to enable interrupts
- It takes a minimum of 4 cycles to execute the ISR address in the interrupt vector table
 - The microprocessor has to complete the instruction it was executing and store the contents of general purpose registers, program counter, as well as the status register before servicing an interrupt
- Global interrupts are automatically disabled when an interrupt occurs and enabled when returning from an ISR

---
name: S17

# ATmega328P Interrupt Pins

- In the ATmega328P the external interrupt pins INT0 and INT1 are PD2 and PD3
- Any of the pin change interrupts (PCINTx) pins can also be used as interrupt sources
 - However they have a shared ISR

.center[<img src="img/328PPins.png" width="320">]

name: S18

# ATmega328P Interrupts Registers

- There is one global interrupt enable bit (I-bit) which enables or disables all interrupts

- Interrupts associated with most peripherals are configured and controlled using bits in their own registers 
- There are usually two bits associated with an interrupt
 - Setting interrupt enable bit causes an interrupt to be triggered by an interrupt event
 - The interrupt flag bit is set whenever an interrupt event occurs regardless of whether the interrupt enable bit is set or cleared
- The interrupt flag bit is cleared automatically when the ISR for the interrupt is executed
 - Alternatively it can be cleared by writing 1 to the flag
- If an interrupt occurs when executing another ISR, the corresponding interrupt flag will be set so that the new interrupt can be serviced after returning from the current ISR

# Status Register (SREG)

.center[<img src="img/SREG.png" width="600">]

- I: *Global Interrupt Enable* must be set for interrupts to be enabled
- The other bits are used by the processor and can be ignored
 - They contain information about the most recently executed instruction by the ALU

# Interrupts Associated with Peripherals

- From the interrupt vector table we can see that the peripherals we will use in the project have interrupts associated with them
- USART0 has receive complete, transmit data register empty and transmit complete interrupts
 - UCSR0B has the interrupt enable bits and UCSR0A has the interrupt flag bits
- ADC has a conversion complete interrupt
 - ADCSRA has both the interrupt enable and flag bits
- TC0 has overflow, compare match A and compare match B interrupts
 - TIMSK0 has the interrupt enable bits and TIFR0 has the interrupt flag bits 
- There are more which you may wish to make use of
 - For example, the zero crossing detector that feeds INT0 can generate an interrupt that could be used to enable taking the set of ADC samples needed for the calculations  
- In this lecture, we will investigate the ADC conversion complete interrupt

---
name: S22

# ADCSRA Register

.center[<img src="img/ADCSRA.png" width="600">]

- ADEN: *ADC Enable*
- ADSC:	*Start Conversion* bit needs to be set to start each conversion in single conversion mode while in free running mode this bit only needs to be set for the first conversion
- ADATE: *Auto Trigger Enable* allows starting an ADC conversion using a trigger signal
- ADIF:	*Interrupt Flag* is set after completing a conversion and cleared when executing the corresponding interrupt
- ADIE:	*Interrupt Enable*
- ADPS[2..0]:	*Prescaler Select* where 000 = 2, 001 = 2, 010 = 4, 011 = 8, 100 = 16, 101 = 32, 110 = 64, 111 = 128

# ADCSRB Register

.center[<img src="img/ADCSRB.png" width="600">]

- .color-grey[ACME:	*Analog Comparator Multiplexer Enable*]
- ADTS[2..0]:	*Auto Trigger Source* when ADATE bit is set, these bits selects which source will initiate an ADC conversion

---
name: S24

# Configuring the ADC

- Lets configure the ADC as per our ADC lecture
 - However, this time we will enable ADC **Conversion Complete Interrupt**
- Remember that we configured the ADC to operate in auto trigger mode with TC0 overflow as source 
 - We will sample ADC0 pin and use TC0 setup from timer lecture (i.e., an overflow every 10&mu;s)
 - An ADC conversion will be auto triggered during overflow event following a conversion complete 
 - Once an ADC conversion is completed and new data is available in ADCL + ADCH registers an interrupt will be generated 

.codes[
```c
void adc_with_interrupt_init(void){
  ADMUX |= 1 << REFS0;        //AVCC set as reference, ADC0 selected and results are right adjusted
  ADCSRA |= (1 << ADEN) | (1 << ADSC) | (1 << ADATE) | (1 << ADIE) | (0b110 << ADPS0);
  //Enable ADC, start conversion, setup auto-trigger, enable interrupts and set prescaler to 64
  ADCSRB |= (0b100 << ADTS0); //Use TC0 overflow as auto- trigger source
  DIDR0 = 1 << ADC0D;         //ADC0 buffer disabled
}
```

# Writing the ISR

- The C language has no specific rules for interrupts
- Creating the interrupt vector table and placing it in memory is handled by Atmel Studio
 - It also provides macros required for interrupts in &#60; avr&#47;interrupt.h &#62;
- An ISR can be declared using the name of the source as listed in the interrupt vector table with *_vect* added at the end
 - In this case we will use *ADC_vect*
- In the ISR we are toggling PB5 while also reading and storing the new *ADC* value in a global variable 

.codes[
```c
//An ISR is declared ISR(source_name_vect) where source_name is as per interrupt vector table

# ISR Rules

- ISRs are usually used to ensure the program responds quickly to certain events
- The processor can only execute one ISR at a time
- Therefore, ensure that your ISR is as short as possible
 - Do not use delays or long loops
 - Do not call expensive functions such as functions used to transmit data over UART
- You should use the interrupt to handle time critical actions, and then set flags to indicate to the main loop that a task needs to be executed
 - For example, use the ISR to read data from the UART, and then set a flag to let the main loop know that there is new data available to process
 - This allows the UART peripheral to receive the next byte

# Interrupt Bugs

- While interrupts are powerful, interrupting the execution flow of your program can introduce bugs if you are not careful
- We discussed the volatile keyword, which prevents compiler optimizations from introducing bugs
- Suppose your interrupt checks a flag to see if a buffer contains some data, and then transmits that data
 - If the interrupt occurs between the flag getting set and the data being put into the buffer you might transmit data that is not the last thing in the buffer
- Similarly, when a multi-byte variable that is modified by an ISR is also used in a function they need to be atomically read/modified 
- Another issue associated with interrupts is stack overflow 
 - We will discuss about this briefly in the following section of the lecture
- You may learn about other problems and how to solve them in future courses 
- For now, try to keep your interrupt code as simple as possible

# Timing in the Project 

- So far we have learnt how to setup the PWM output, read V<sub>out</sub> using ADC and implement a PI controller
 - The PWM was setup to have a 100kHz frequency (i.e., 10&micro;s time-period)
 - The ADC took 54&micro;s to complete a conversion and takes a new V<sub>out</sub> reading every 60&micro;s
- The PI controller ideally needs to be modified to execute within under 60&micro;s

# RAM Allocation

.left-column[
- Recall that RAM is one of the three core resources a microcontroller has
- RAM is split into three sections
 - The Stack: Used for temporary storage of variables associated with functions and grows as functions are called, and shrinks as functions return
 - The Heap: Used for storing dynamic variables using malloc and it is set to a fixed size by the programmer
 - The Data Segment: Used for storage of variables with greater than function scope (static or global), which are allocated at compile time and is set to a fixed size depending on how many of these variables need to be stored

# RAM Considerations

- The combined size of the stack, heap, and data segment cannot exceed the size of RAM
 - Running out of space is called a “stack collision” or “stack overflow”
- You need to be aware of this in your program
 - If you have unexplained crashes/behavior, you may have a stack collision
- High stack usage can be attributed to 
 - Many nested function calls (especially recursion)
 - Allocating large arrays inside functions
- High heap usage can be attributed to 
 - Using malloc() to create large dynamic arrays
 - Not releasing allocated memory using free()
- High data usage can be attributed to 
 - Allocating large arrays with static or global scope
- Be careful when allocating arrays to store data in your project

# The Stack

- The stack is a consecutive block of data which stores
 - Local variables
 - Function parameters and return values for each function called
 - Return addresses for each function/ISR called
 - Temporary storage of register values
- Usually the stack starts at the last RAM address (highest) and grows down

# How Does the Stack Operate?

- The stack operates as a last-in-first-out (LIFO) buffer
- The stack pointer stores the address of the next available location on the stack
- The stack pointer is decremented each time data is placed onto the stack (pushed)
- The stack pointer is incremented each time data is removed from the stack (popped)

# The Push Operation

- To add data to the stack it is “pushed” to the stack pointer address, and the stack pointer is then increased
&nbsp;

# The Pop Operation

- To remove data from the stack the stack pointer is decreased, and then data is “popped” out from the stack pointer address

# Example: Investigating the Use of RAM

.questions[
Simulate the following code in Atmel Studio and comment on how the RAM is used.
]
.codes[
```c
#include <avr/io.h>

volatile uint16_t voltages_mv[20];    //Which part of memory is this stored?
volatile uint16_t voltage_rms_mv = 0; //Which part of memory is this stored?

uint16_t my_func(uint16_t data_in){   //How is the function input communicated?
  static uint16_t x;                  //Which part of memory is this stored?
  uint16_t y = 600;					
  x = x + data_in + y;
  return x;
}

int main(void){
  uint16_t a = 2000;					
  uint16_t b = 4000;					
  voltage_rms_mv = b/4;             //What happens to the global variable?
  voltages_mv[0] = a+voltages_mv;   //What happens to the global variable?
  uint16_t c = my_func(5000);       //What get pushed when jumping and what get popped when returning?
}
```

# Context Switching

- While a function is executing (such as during normal program operation) it uses the microprocessor register file
 - The register file is where variables which are being actively used are stored, such as inputs for arithmetic operations, loop counters etc.
 - The ATmega328P has 32 registers 
- The ISR will also use the register file, so before executing an ISR the data in the registers that are used must be pushed to the stack
 - You need to make sure that there is sufficient space in the stack
- In addition, the program counter and the status register also needs to be pushed to the stack
- After the ISR completes, these values are loaded back from the stack
- This process is called a “context switch” 
 - The compiler automatically adds these instructions to the ISR

# ISR Execution Delay

- The time taken to start executing an ISR is limited by how long the context switch takes
 - This delay time is an important design parameter
