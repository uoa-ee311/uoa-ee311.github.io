# What is a Power Converter?

- A power converter takes an energy source as the input and produce an output that is suitable to feed a load (e.g. electronic/electrical circuit or a motor)
- As an example, a power converter may be designed to take an input from a battery and produce a constant current (even when the battery voltage changes as it discharges) to feed an LED light bulb
 - We may also want to control the current setpoint to change the brightness of the LED bulb

# Important Features of a Power Converter  


- Designing a power converter involves improving 5 key performance features 
 - Losses need to be minimized to achieve higher efficiency
 - Weight and volume need to be minimized to achieve higher density
 - Failure rate needs to be minimized to achieve higher reliability
 - Costs need to be minimized so that its ready to market within an acceptable time frame and a budget
 - Controllability needs to be improved so that it can produce a distortion-less output 
- These performance features are related to each other 
 - E.g., improving efficiency can often lead to an increase in cost and restrict controllability 
- Depending on the application, a power electronics engineer often has to tradeoff some features for others 
 - E.g., we may decide to go with a less efficient design to reduce cost

# Types of Power Converters

.left-column[
- Based on the nature of the input source and the output produced, power converters can be broadly categorized as
 - *DC to DC* converters where input source is DC and output is DC
 - *DC to AC* converters where input source is DC and output is AC
 - *AC to DC* converters where input source is AC and output is DC
 - *AC to AC* converters where input source is AC and output is AC
- These 4 types of power converters can be categorized further as *isolated* and *non-isolated* converters
 - An isolated converter often employs a transformer to provide galvanic isolation between input source and load in situations where for example to ensure user safety
- E.g., your phone charger employs an *isolated AC to DC converter* to derive power from wall power socket and output 5V DC

# The Project

- What is this course about and what should you expect to learn?
 - Gives you an opportunity to design and develop a commonly used switched-mode power supply using the electrical, magnetic, control and embedded programing principles you learnt so far
 - During this process you will gain knowledge, experience, skill-set and professional behavior needed to succeed in more challenging projects you will engage as an engineer
- What would you design and engineer during this course?
 - A compact programmable power supply that could replace the bulky bench-top power supply 
- How would you achieve this task?
 - A *flyback* type power converter is developed to generate an *isolated* DC voltage between 5V and 30V from a 20V DC source
 - A suitable *high-frequency isolation transformer* is designed for the flyback flyback converter while off-the-shelf digital isolators are used to isolate communication signals
 - An *embedded software program* is developed to control the output voltage of the converter to voltage requested by the user

# A Typical Work Bench Power Supply

- A low voltage DC power supply is an essential equipment found on a work bench of a hardware engineer
 - Typically has 1 or more independent isolated outputs
 - The voltage and current at each output can be controlled/programmed via a user interface

# Architecture of a Typical LV Power Supply

- A 50Hz transformer with multiple taps is used to generate an isolated output 
 - This low-frequency transformer is the main contributor to size and weight 
- A series type linear regulator is used to regulate the output to value set by the user 
 - Efficiency improved by switching between taps of the transformer

# Internals of a Typical LV Power Supply

- Internal circuitry show the size of the low-frequency transformer used
 - We will use a high-frequency transformer to significantly reduce the size and weight
- Second largest component is the heatsink used to cool the linear regulator 
 - We will use a more efficient switched mode regulator to overcome this problem

# Suggested System Architecture 

.center[<img src="img/System.png" height="320">]

- You will derive the 20V DC source needed to power your design from a bench-top power supply
 - In real-life, you can use a USB-C PD interface to derive the 20V DC
- A 220&Omega; rheostat will be used as the load to test and characterize you power supply

# Expected Output Characteristics

- Designing a power supply that can deliver 12W at any output voltage level (between 5V and 30V) is significantly more complicated
 - Even commercial power supplies for this reason limit the output in some manner
- To reduce the complexity of your design, it is expected to follow the output characteristics define by the output voltage vs. power curve below
 - If you wish to improve power output at low voltages, then you must first discuss your solutions and seek approval

# Working in Teams

- You will work in a team of 4 
 - You can chose your team members and register your group details on Canvas by the end of 1st week
 - All team members should be from the same lab stream (NB: There are two lab streams)
- Throughout the project work as a team and aim to support each other
 - This is an important part of preparing to be a professional engineer
 - You depend on each other to do well in this course
- Plan your work, document your work and communicate regularly with your team members
 - Use a logbook and/or [Trello](https://trello.com) to plan and document your work 
 - Use [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/) and [Zoom](https://zoom.us)/[Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com) for team communications
 - Use [GitHub](https://github.com) and [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com)/[Office 365](https://www.library.auckland.ac.nz/services/it-essentials/computer-facilities/software-personal-use/microsoft-student-advantage-office-365) products to collaborate with team members
- Be patient with your team members even if they are not making much progress during the initial stage
 - If things are not working out, after about 1-2 weeks, let us know
 - If a member is not engaging in team work we will ask that person to work alone

# How to Get an Excellent Grade

- Is the project challenging?
 - Yes, design and developing your first switched-mode power supply can be quite challenging
 - You need to have a good mastery of circuit analysis techniques, magnetics, control and embedded programming
- What are the most challenging aspects?
 - Time management, planing and team work are the key challenges
 - As in a real life project, resources are limited (time, teams' availability, lab space, equipment, software licenses, etc.) and therefore last minute frantic endeavour will not help
- How could I get an excellent grade?
 - Enjoy designing a real-world product and be passionate about your design (this is the key ingredient)
 - Plan and manage your and your team members' time well
 - Throughout the semester you are expected to spend about 12 hours a week on the project 
 - Make full use of all support sessions (there will be in average of about 8 support hours a week)

# Are Design Courses Useful?

- Engineering a solution to solve a real-life problem helps you to understand the importance of the theoretical concepts you have learnt and teach you how to use these to achieve an output that could help the society

# Final Interview & Deliverables

- During the last week of the semester there will be an interview to evaluate your understanding of the subject matter
 - Theoretical and practical knowledge of hardware (5%) and firmware (5%) concepts you gained during the project will be assessed 
 - Though you will participate in the interviews as a team, you will be assessed individually 
 - You will be assessed based on technical accuracy and completeness of the answers given as well as your ability to confidently explain technical concepts 
 - The experience gained through this process will be invaluable to do well in technical job interviews
- During the last week of the semester you will be given an opportunity to demonstration your final design
 - Design will be evaluated based on functionality (10%), quality of output (7.5%) and quality of design (7.5%) 
 - Marks for output quality will be scaled relative to best in class 
 - You are also required to submit a short technical report with details of your design (10%)

# Collaborating with Team Members

- To be a good engineer you also need to develop a number of *soft-skills*
 - Some of the key skills you should aim to develop are management, teamwork and communication 
- One of the primary responsibilities you will have as an engineer is to tell other engineers how to build, service, use and update a product you have been involved in designing/developing/building/testing/etc.
 - Thus, engineers are expected to document all details about their work in a logbook 
 - The information recorded in a logbook include, design notes, design decisions, calculations, software flow diagrams, schematics, meeting minutes, etc. 
- In industry, many different digital tools are used to help with managing teamwork work, communicating with team members and documenting details of the project
 - Trello, Slack and GitHub are a few such most commonly used and simple to use tools 
- In this project all students are expected to use a logbook and/or Trello together with Slack and GitHub to effectively plan, manage and document the work
 - We will regularly check how you use these tools as part of the assessment process
