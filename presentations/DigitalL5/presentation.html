# Why Communicate?

.center[<img src="img/CommsGen.png" height="200">]

- A microcontroller seldom works in isolation
- In a typical system, a microcontroller is expected to share information with other devices around it
- To share information, microcontrollers need to communicate with other processors, modules, sensors, displays, etc.
- The communication can be for the functioning of the circuit (e.g. reading a temperature sensor), or for debugging and diagnostics (e.g. logging data to a PC)

---

name: S3

# What are Communication Protocols?

- Communication with a microcontroller can be implemented in different ways
- To communicate the transmitter and receiver must agree on a specific communication protocol
 - Analogous to a spoken language, a protocol defines how information is communicated by varying a physical quantity, called the transmission medium
 - Protocols can be implemented in software or hardware
- Transmission mediums could include voltage, current, light, RF waves, acoustic waves, etc.

# Data Transmission Modes 

- Transmission modes can be broadly categorized as simplex/duplex, synchronous/asynchronous and serial/parallel
- In simplex implementations data is transferred from A to B only while in full-duplex implementations data is transferred from A to B and B to A simultaneously
 - In half-duplex implementations data is transferred from A to B or B to A, but not simultaneously
 - Duplex implementations allow bidirectional communication, but could require more channels (e.g. a wire each for send and receive)

# Synchronous vs Asynchronous Transmission
&nbsp;
.center[<img src="img/Sync.png" height="140">]
&nbsp;
- In synchronous mode a separate signal is used to indicate the start of each piece of data being transmitted 
 - Often this signal is called a clock signal, like the clock used in synchronous digital circuits
 - Require more channels (e.g. separate clock wire) but have lower overhead and higher throughput
- In asynchronous mode a special “sync” event is transmitted on the data line to provide a reference point in time
 - Need to have a common understanding of time, and therefore is vulnerable to variations

---
name: S6

# Serial vs Parallel Transmission
&nbsp;
.center[<img src="img/SerialParallel.png" height="90">]
&nbsp;
- In serial mode only one symbol is sent at a time while in parallel multiple symbols are sent simultaneously
 - Parallel mode can send more data at a time, but require more channels (e.g. one wire per bit)
- A “symbol” is the data sent each time interval
 - In a digital (binary) system there are only two symbols, ‘0’ and ‘1’, which are referred to as bits
- There are many different communication protocols and each follow different data transmission modes
 - For example a certain protocol could implement half-duplex, synchronous, parallel communication

---
name: S7

# Common Communication Protocols

- There are many more parameters which define a communication protocol
 - We have just looked at some of the major ones
- The embedded industry has adopted a number of common communication protocols
- Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
 - Implements full-duplex, serial and synchronous communication
- Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)
 - Implements half-duplex, serial and synchronous communication
- Controller Area Network (CAN)
 - Implements half-duplex, serial and asynchronous communication
- Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)
 - Implements full-duplex, serial and asynchronous communication
- Universal Serial Bus (USB)
 - Implements full or half duplex, serial and asynchronous communication

# Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter

- UART protocol is considered one of the simplest, cheapest and widely used
 - Commonly used for low data-rate applications like GPS, sensors, modems, etc.
- Data goes out on the transmit (TX) line and comes in on the receive (RX) line
 - The TX on microcontroller connects to RX on the device it is communicating with
 - Implements full-duplex, serial and asynchronous communication
- The microcontroller and the device are connected using 3 lines/wires (TX, RX and a ground) 
 - If only needing simplex communication, 2 lines/wires are sufficient (ground, and TX/RX)
- There are extensions to the protocol which add flow control and synchronous transmission (i.e. USART)

# UART Communication in Your Project

.center[<img src="img/System.png" height="280">]

- The MCU of the flyback convert needs to communicate with a PC
 - A USB-UART module is provided to interface the MCU with a PC
- You need to use the UART peripheral to send data to and receive data from a PC  
 - Measured V<sub>out</sub> is sent to PC and V<sub>ref</sub> received from PC is used as reference 

---
name: S10

# UART Data Transmission 

- When transmitting data through UART, each bit in a byte of data is sent at a time in a sequential fashion along the wire/line that connects TX to RX of the two devices 
 - A shift registers is used to convert the byte into individual bits to send during each time interval
 - The Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) is transmitted first
- UART on the receiving device receives each bit in sequence and reassembles them into the original byte

.center[<img src="img/UARTDataTx.png" height="225">]


---
name: S11

# UART Frame Format

- Each data byte transmitted is preceded by a start-bit, which is indicated by a logic "0"
 - The start-bit (“sync” bit) tells the receiver when to expect a data byte from the microcontroller 
- Each data byte transmitted is ended with at least one stop bit, which is indicated by a logic "1"
 - The stop bit(s) ensures the receiver can detect the next start bit
- The “idle” state (i.e. when not sending any data) of the line is logic "1"
 - This is historical from using UARTs for telegraphy
- An optional parity bit may be included before the stop-bit(s)
 - The parity bit allows the receiver to detect some instances of corruption
- “[data bits]N[stop bits] [parity type if any]” naming scheme used
 - E.g. “8N1 with odd parity” means 8 data bits are sent then an odd parity bit and 1 stop bit

# UART Waveforms (PI)

.center[<img src="img/UARTWaveform.png" height="310">]

- A UART “frame” or “packet” composes of a start bit, data bits, parity bit (if used), and a stop bit (or 2)
 - Bits are represented by voltage levels VCC (for logic "1") and 0V (for logic "0")
 - Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) is transmitted first

 - Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) is transmitted first 

---
name: S14

# UART Baud Rate

.center[<img src="img/UARTUBRR.png" height="230">]

- The amount of time between each bit being transmitted is determined by the baud rate
\\[ \text{Time per Bit} = \frac{1}{\text{Baud Rate}} \\]
- Standard baud rates are 4800, 9600, 19200 etc.
 - Technically you can use any baud rate but not all are supported by a given devices

---
name: S15

# Baud Rate vs Data Rate

- The time taken to send one bit is set by the baud rate
- Total bits sent per frame include the start bit, data bits, parity bit (if used), and a stop bit (or 2)
- As an example, consider an 8N1 with no parity scheme 
 - The UART frame would consist of 1 start bit, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit 
 - Therefore, we would need to send 10 bits per frame of which only 8 are data bits
- The data rate in bits per second (bps) when using UART communication is therefore
\\[ \text{Data Rate} = \frac{\text{Data Bits per Frame}}{\text{Total Bits per Frame}} \times \text{Baud Rate} \\]
- The time taken to transmit a certain number of data bits is therefore
\\[ \text{Transmission Time} = \frac{\text{Data Bits to Transmit}}{\text{Data Rate}} \\]

- UDR0 register contains the UART data 
- The remaining four registers are used to control the peripheral
 - Some fields are set by the user to control the operation
 - Some fields are set by the UART to indicate its current state

# UDR0 Register

.center[<img src="img/UDR0.png" width="600">]

- The transmit data buffer (TXB) and receive data buffer (RXB) registers share the same address
 - The register accessed depends on whether a read or write is executed by the code
- When setup to transmit data 
 - The code loads the data byte to transmit into the TXB register through UDR0
 - When the transmit shift register is empty the data in TXB register will be loaded automatically into the transmit shift register 
 - Each bit in the transmit shift register will be automatically transmitted one at a time as [we learnt previously](#S10)
- When setup to receive data
 - Once the receive shift register receive a data byte, it is automatically copied into the RXB register

# Calculating Value of UBRR0

.center[<img src="img/UARTClock.png" width="500">]

- The UBRR0 value defines the prescaler applied to used to the system clock (f<sub>osc</sub>) to obtain the UART clock (i.e. UART clock = (f<sub>osc</sub> / (UBRR0 + 1))
- Under normal operation the UART clock needs to be 16 times the baud rate and therefore
\\[ \text{Baud Rate} = \frac{f\_{osc}} {16 \times \left( UBRR0 + 1 \right) } \quad \text {or} \quad UBRR0 = \frac {f\_{osc}} {\left( \text {Baud Rate} \right) \times 16}  - 1\\]

# Configuring the UART

- First we need to configure the UART as per our specifications 
 - Need to set the bits of the [UCSR0A](#S24), [UCSR0B](#S25), [UCSR0C](#S26) and [UBRR0](#S27) registers 
 - Have to configure the bits of the DDRD register associated with TX and RX pins (done by default)
 - Lets configure the UART peripheral to 57600 baud, 8N1 with no parity  
 - Both receive and transmit interrupts are enabled 

.codes[
```c
void UART_init_inturpt(void){
  UCSR0B |= 1 << TXEN0 | 1 << RXEN0 | 1 << TXCIE0 | 1 << RXCIE0;	
  //Enable transmit, receive, and interrupt, UCSZ02=0 (default - 8 data bits))
  UCSR0C |= 3 << UCSZ00;      //UMSEL0[1..0]=00 (default - UART mode), UPM0[1..0]=00 (default - no parity),
  //USBS0=0 (default - 1 stop bit), UCSZ0[1..0]=11 (default - 8 data bits)
  UBRR0 = F_CPU / ((uint32_t)16 * BAUD_RATE) - 1;
  //Set UBRR0 as per baud rate formula
}
```

# Receiving Data

- When a byte of data arrives at the RX pin, it is loaded to UDR0 and an interrupt is triggered 
 - Lets use an incoming message format of "XXXXX\r\n" where XXXXX is V_ref in mV
 - In the ISR, as each byte of data is received, store the received byte in an array used as a buffer 
 - Use '\r' character to determine the end of incoming message 

.codes[
```c
ISR(USART_RX_vect){
  rx_buffer[rx_byte_pos] = UDR0;        //Store received character to next position of array
  rx_byte_pos++;                        //Increment buffer position
  rx_complete_flag = 0;                 //Indicate message not ready to read
  if(rx_buffer[rx_byte_pos-1] == '\r'){ //Check if a carriage return entered indicating end of message
    rx_buffer[rx_byte_pos-1] = '\0';    //Replace \r with a null to indicate end of message
    rx_complete_flag = 1;               //Indicate message ready to read
    rx_byte_pos = 0;                    //Reset position in array
  }
  else if(rx_byte_pos > (RX_BUFFER_SIZE -1)){	
    rx_byte_pos = 0;                    //If buffer full discard message and reset buffer 
	}
  PIN_TOGGLE(PINB5);                    //Toggle pin to indicate ISR execution 
}
```

# Transmitting Data

- We can use a similar approach used to receive a message to send a message 
 - The message to be sent can be loaded on to an array used as a buffer 
 - A message format similar to "XXXXX\r\n" where XXXXX is V_out in mV, can be used 
 - We can use a flag to indicate the ISR that a new message is ready to be transmitted 
 - In the UART TX ISR, we need to load one byte at a time to UDR0 
 - Use '\r' character to determine the end of outgoing message and reset the flag 

.codes[
```c
ISR(USART_TX_vect){

//Write your UART transmit code here 

}
```

# Why Do We Need Character Encoding?

- UART communication protocol allows us to successfully transfer data between a microcontroller and external devices
 - UART can send a single byte of data at a time
- If we only want to send numbers between 0-255 (or -128 to 127) then this works, but what if we want to send other data types?
 - For example how to send alphanumeric characters, larger numbers, key-value pairs, etc.
- We call these desired values our “character set”
- Encoding determines how our character set is represented by the data we can send
- There are many types of character encoding systems
 - ASCII, ANSI, Unicode and UTF are a few common encoding systems
- ASCII maps letters (upper and lower case), numbers (0-9), and special characters, to the range 0-127
 - For example, 0x48 is used to represent the character ‘H’

# Using *printf* and *sprintf* 

- The *printf* and *sprintf* commands uses ASCII encoding
 - These commands take an input string, format it, and output it
- To use *printf* and *sprintf* **#include &lt; stdio.h &gt;** 
- For your project it may be easier to convert between ASCII and integer by adding or subtracting 48

.codes[
```c
int main(void){	
	
  //Code....

  char tx_buffer[TX_BUFFER_SIZE];
  sprintf(tx_buffer,"%d\r\n", 15370);

  while(1){

    //Code...

  }

}
```

# Developing Modular Software

- You should be developing modular software that is easy to follow
 - For example, all code relating each peripheral can be in a separate .c file, with a corresponding .h file
 - Allows code reuse, manageable and readable code, easy to collaborate, easy to test and validate
- As an example, lets consider the code developed to use the UART
 - Use a separate C source file called *uart.c* and a corresponding header file called *uart.h*, which will hold function prototypes for all functions in *uart.c*
 - The *uart.h* should **#include** as few other .h files as possible and it should be protected against multiple **#include**
 - **#include "uart.h"** in *uart.c* together with any necessary .h files
 - **#include "uart.h"** in *main.c* so that we can access our UART functions
- You may also want a shared .h such as *common.h* for global **#define** for example **#define F_CPU**
 - Avoid sharing global variables between .c files by declaring them as *static*
