# Why Communicate?

.center[<img src="img/CommsGen.png" height="200">]

- A microcontroller seldom works in isolation
- In a typical system, a microcontroller is expected to share information with other devices around it
- To share information, microcontrollers need to communicate with other processors, modules, sensors, displays, etc.
- The communication can be for the functioning of the circuit (e.g. reading a temperature sensor), or for debugging and diagnostics (e.g. logging data to a PC)

---

name: S3

# What are Communication Protocols?

- Communication with a microcontroller can be implemented in different ways
- To communicate the transmitter and receiver must agree on a specific communication protocol
 - Analogous to a spoken language, a protocol defines how information is communicated by varying a physical quantity, called the transmission medium
 - Protocols can be implemented in software or hardware
- Transmission mediums could include voltage, current, light, RF waves, acoustic waves, etc.

# Data Transmission Modes 

- Transmission modes can be broadly categorized as simplex/duplex, synchronous/asynchronous and serial/parallel
- In simplex implementations data is transferred from A to B only while in full-duplex implementations data is transferred from A to B and B to A simultaneously
 - In half-duplex implementations data is transferred from A to B or B to A, but not simultaneously
 - Duplex implementations allow bidirectional communication, but could require more channels (e.g. a wire each for send and receive)

# Synchronous vs Asynchronous Transmission
&nbsp;
.center[<img src="img/Sync.png" height="140">]
&nbsp;
- In synchronous mode a separate signal is used to indicate the start of each piece of data being transmitted 
 - Often this signal is called a clock signal, like the clock used in synchronous digital circuits
 - Require more channels (e.g. separate clock wire) but have lower overhead and higher throughput
- In asynchronous mode a special “sync” event is transmitted on the data line to provide a reference point in time
 - Need to have a common understanding of time, and therefore is vulnerable to variations

---
name: S6

# Serial vs Parallel Transmission
&nbsp;
.center[<img src="img/SerialParallel.png" height="90">]
&nbsp;
- In serial mode only one symbol is sent at a time while in parallel multiple symbols are sent simultaneously
 - Parallel mode can send more data at a time, but require more channels (e.g. one wire per bit)
- A “symbol” is the data sent each time interval
 - In a digital (binary) system there are only two symbols, ‘0’ and ‘1’, which are referred to as bits
- There are many different communication protocols and each follow different data transmission modes
 - For example a certain protocol could implement half-duplex, synchronous, parallel communication

---
name: S7

# Common Communication Protocols

- There are many more parameters which define a communication protocol
 - We have just looked at some of the major ones
- The embedded industry has adopted a number of common communication protocols
- Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
 - Implements full-duplex, serial and synchronous communication
- Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)
 - Implements half-duplex, serial and synchronous communication
- Controller Area Network (CAN)
 - Implements half-duplex, serial and asynchronous communication
- Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)
 - Implements full-duplex, serial and asynchronous communication
- Universal Serial Bus (USB)
 - Implements full or half duplex, serial and asynchronous communication

# Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter

- UART protocol is considered one of the simplest, cheapest and widely used
 - Commonly used for low data-rate applications like GPS, sensors, modems, etc.
- Data goes out on the transmit (TX) line and comes in on the receive (RX) line
 - The TX on microcontroller connects to RX on the device it is communicating with
 - Implements full-duplex, serial and asynchronous communication
- The microcontroller and the device are connected using 3 lines/wires (TX, RX and a ground) 
 - If only needing simplex communication, 2 lines/wires are sufficient (ground, and TX/RX)
- There are extensions to the protocol which add flow control and synchronous transmission (i.e. USART)

# UART Communication in Your Project

.center[<img src="img/System.png" height="280">]

- The MCU of the flyback convert needs to communicate with a PC
 - A USB-UART module is provided to interface the MCU with a PC
- You need to use the UART peripheral to send data to and receive data from a PC  
 - Measured V<sub>out</sub> is sent to PC and V<sub>ref</sub> received from PC is used as reference 

---
name: S10

# UART Data Transmission 

- When transmitting data through UART, each bit in a byte of data is sent at a time in a sequential fashion along the wire/line that connects TX to RX of the two devices 
 - A shift registers is used to convert the byte into individual bits to send during each time interval
 - The Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) is transmitted first
- UART on the receiving device receives each bit in sequence and reassembles them into the original byte

.center[<img src="img/UARTDataTx.png" height="225">]


---
name: S11

# UART Frame Format

- Each data byte transmitted is preceded by a start-bit, which is indicated by a logic "0"
 - The start-bit (“sync” bit) tells the receiver when to expect a data byte from the microcontroller 
- Each data byte transmitted is ended with at least one stop bit, which is indicated by a logic "1"
 - The stop bit(s) ensures the receiver can detect the next start bit
- The “idle” state (i.e. when not sending any data) of the line is logic "1"
 - This is historical from using UARTs for telegraphy
- An optional parity bit may be included before the stop-bit(s)
 - The parity bit allows the receiver to detect some instances of corruption
- “[data bits]N[stop bits] [parity type if any]” naming scheme used
 - E.g. “8N1 with odd parity” means 8 data bits are sent then an odd parity bit and 1 stop bit

# UART Waveforms (PI)

.center[<img src="img/UARTWaveform.png" height="310">]

- A UART “frame” or “packet” composes of a start bit, data bits, parity bit (if used), and a stop bit (or 2)
 - Bits are represented by voltage levels VCC (for logic "1") and 0V (for logic "0")
 - Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) is transmitted first

 - Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) is transmitted first 

---
name: S14

# UART Baud Rate

.center[<img src="img/UARTUBRR.png" height="230">]

- The amount of time between each bit being transmitted is determined by the baud rate
\\[ \text{Time per Bit} = \frac{1}{\text{Baud Rate}} \\]
- Standard baud rates are 4800, 9600, 19200 etc.
 - Technically you can use any baud rate but not all are supported by a given devices

---
name: S15

# Baud Rate vs Data Rate

- The time taken to send one bit is set by the baud rate
- Total bits sent per frame include the start bit, data bits, parity bit (if used), and a stop bit (or 2)
- As an example, consider an 8N1 with no parity scheme 
 - The UART frame would consist of 1 start bit, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit 
 - Therefore, we would need to send 10 bits per frame of which only 8 are data bits
- The data rate in bits per second (bps) when using UART communication is therefore
\\[ \text{Data Rate} = \frac{\text{Data Bits per Frame}}{\text{Total Bits per Frame}} \times \text{Baud Rate} \\]
- The time taken to transmit a certain number of data bits is therefore
\\[ \text{Transmission Time} = \frac{\text{Data Bits to Transmit}}{\text{Data Rate}} \\]

- UDR0 register contains the UART data 
- The remaining four registers are used to control the peripheral
 - Some fields are set by the user to control the operation
 - Some fields are set by the UART to indicate its current state

# UDR0 Register

.center[<img src="img/UDR0.png" width="600">]

- The transmit data buffer (TXB) and receive data buffer (RXB) registers share the same address
 - The register accessed depends on whether a read or write is executed by the code
- When setup to transmit data 
 - The code loads the data byte to transmit into the TXB register through UDR0
 - When the transmit shift register is empty the data in TXB register will be loaded automatically into the transmit shift register 
 - Each bit in the transmit shift register will be automatically transmitted one at a time as [we learnt previously](#S10)
- When setup to receive data
 - Once the receive shift register receive a data byte, it is automatically copied into the RXB register

# Calculating Value of UBRR0

.center[<img src="img/UARTClock.png" width="500">]

- The UBRR0 value defines the prescaler applied to used to the system clock (f<sub>osc</sub>) to obtain the UART clock (i.e. UART clock = (f<sub>osc</sub> / (UBRR0 + 1))
- Under normal operation the UART clock needs to be 16 times the baud rate and therefore
\\[ \text{Baud Rate} = \frac{f\_{osc}} {16 \times \left( UBRR0 + 1 \right) } \quad \text {or} \quad UBRR0 = \frac {f\_{osc}} {\left( \text {Baud Rate} \right) \times 16}  - 1\\]

# Configuring the UART

- First we need to configure the UART as per our specifications 
 - Need to set the bits of the [UCSR0A](#S24), [UCSR0B](#S25), [UCSR0C](#S26) and [UBRR0](#S27) registers 
 - Have to configure the bits of the DDRD register associated with TX and RX pins (done by default)
 - Lets configure the UART peripheral to 115200 baud, 8N1 with no parity  

.codes[
```c
// This function configures the UART to 9600 baud, 8N1 with no parity
void uart_init(uint32_t baud_rate){
  UCSR0A = 0b00000000;    //None of the settings here are used
  UCSR0B = 0b00001000;    //Set TXEN0 bit to 1 (enable transmit) and UCSZ02 bit to 0 (8 data bits)
                          //To improve readability we should aim to write this in the form "UCSR0B = (1&#60;&#60;TXEN0);"
  UCSR0C = 0b00000110;    //UMSEL0[1..0]=00 (UART mode), UPM0[1..0]=00 (no parity), 
                          //USBS0=0 (1 stop-bit), UCSZ0[1..0]=11 (8 data bits)
  UBRR0 = 2000000 / (16 * baud_rate) - 1;
                          //Set UBRR0 as per baud rate formula
}
```

# Transmitting a Data Byte

- We also know how to use the UART registers to transmit data
 - We send data by loading the data byte to be sent into the UDR0 register
 - UDR0 needs to be ready for the new data byte and this can be checked by making sure the UDRE0 bit in the UCSR0A register is set
 - We typically do the above in a function dedicated to transmitting a byte

.codes[
```c
// This function transmits a single byte via the UART
void uart_transmit_byte(char byte){	
  while ((UCSR0A & 0b00100000) == 0){       //UDRE0 bit is checked to see if it is 0 
  ;                                         //If UDRE0 bit is not 0, wait until it becomes 0	
  }

  //Put the byte to be sent into the UDR0 register
  UDR0 = byte;
}
```
]

# Transmitting an Array of Bytes

- We can also write a function that can transmit an array of bytes 
 - In a loop, we need to transmit one byte at a time by calling the function we wrote to transmit a byte
 - The number of bytes in the array is determined using the method *strlen* 
 - To use *strlen* you need to **#include &lt; string.h &gt;**

.codes[
```c
//This function transmits an array of bytes via the UART using uart_transmit_byte(char byte)function
void uart_transmit_array(char* msg){
	//Loop through each byte in the array 
	for (uint8_t i = 0; i < strlen(msg); i++){		
		uart_transmit_byte(msg[i]);				//Transmit each byte using uart_transmit_byte(char byte)
	}	
}
```

# Why Do We Need Character Encoding?

- UART communication protocol allows us to successfully transfer data between a microcontroller and external devices
 - UART can send a single byte of data at a time
- If we only want to send numbers between 0-255 (or -128 to 127) then this works, but what if we want to send other data types?
 - For example how to send alphanumeric characters, larger numbers, key-value pairs, etc.
- We call these desired values our “character set”
- Encoding determines how our character set is represented by the data we can send
- There are many types of character encoding systems
 - ASCII, ANSI, Unicode and UTF are a few common encoding systems
- ASCII maps letters (upper and lower case), numbers (0-9), and special characters, to the range 0-127
 - For example, 0x48 is used to represent the character ‘H’

# Completing the UART Code

.codes[
```c
#define F_CPU 2000000UL                     //Defining system clock frequency

#include <avr/io.h>                         //Needed for using the macros for register addresses
#include <string.h>                         //Needed for using strlen()
#include <util/delay.h>                     //Needed for using _delay_ms()

//Prototypes of functions used
void uart_init(uint32_t baud_rate);     
void uart_transmit_byte(char byte);
void uart_transmit_array(char* msg);

int main(void){

  uart_init(9600);                          //Initializing the UART to 9600 baud, 8N1, with no parity

  while (1){
    uart_transmit_byte(0x48);               //Transmitting character 'H' - alternatively uart_transmit_byte('A');
    uart_transmit_array("ello World\n\r");  //Transmitting string "ello World" with newline character '\n'
                                            //and carriage return character '\r'
    _delay_ms(1000);                        //Transmit above characters every 1s
  }
}
```

# Using *printf* and *sprintf* (PI)

- The *printf* and *sprintf* commands uses ASCII encoding
 - These commands take an input string, format it, and output it
- To use *printf* and *sprintf* **#include &lt; stdio.h &gt;** 
- We also need to redirect the output of *printf* to use the UART and to do this we bind a function which transmits a character via the UART

.codes[
```c
//Creating a stream variable
static FILE usart_stdout = FDEV_SETUP_STREAM(uart_printf, NULL, _FDEV_SETUP_WRITE);

int main(void)
{
  stdout = &usart_stdout;         //Binding the stream variable to stdout	
  uart_init(9600);                //Initializing the UART to 9600 baud, 8N1 with no parity
  
  while (1){
    printf("Hello World\r\n");    //Printing "Hello World"
    _delay_ms(1000);              //Transmit message every 1s
  }
}
```

# Using *printf* and *sprintf* (PII)

- To use *printf* we need a new function called *uart_printf*

.codes[
```c
int uart_printf(char var, FILE *stream) {
	uart_transmit_byte(var);      //Using our original function to transmit UART data
	return 0;
}
```
]

- Both *printf* and *sprintf* take a format string which defines the output together with a set of arguments
- Format specifiers stating with % sign tell where to put these arguments and how to format them

.codes[
```c
printf("Color %s, Number %d, Hex %X","Red", 125, 125);
```
]

- When using sprintf the output is written into a character array
 - An example of using *sprintf* is provided in the UART lab
- The main drawback of using *printf* and *sprintf* is the overhead they add in a very resource limited environment

# Developing Modular Software

- At this stage you should be learning to develop modular software
 - For example, all code relating each peripheral can be in a separate .c file, with a corresponding .h file
 - Allows code reuse, manageable and readable code, easy to collaborate, easy to test and validate
- As an example, lets consider the code developed to use the UART
 - Use a separate C source file called *uart.c* and a corresponding header file called *uart.h*, which will hold function prototypes for all functions in *uart.c*
 - The *uart.h* should **#include** as few other .h files as possible and it should be protected against multiple **#include**
 - **#include "uart.h"** in *uart.c* together with any necessary .h files
 - **#include "uart.h"** in *main.c* so that we can access our UART functions
- You may also want a shared .h such as *common.h* for global **#define** for example **#define F_CPU**
 - Avoid sharing global variables between .c files by declaring them as *static*

# Things To Note

- Your transmit function is blocking and your MCU cannot do anything else while transmitting over the UART
 - It can interfere with code that has timing constraints
 - DO NOT use UART transmissions from within time critical tasks like interrupts
- You must understand examples you use for the lab or the project
 - Your individual understanding will be assessed during all assessments 
 - During 2nd test you will have to develop a C program yourself and simulate it on Proteus
 - All team members must therefore understand every part of the design
- It is critical that you complete the pre-lab of the UART lab before your lab session so that you can get help with the later parts of the lab
 - Please do not waste the opportunity to get support in the labs 
 - With many students in the class, closer to due dates, there will be limited opportunities to ask for help 
- You need to demonstrate UART transmission during your midsemester review
